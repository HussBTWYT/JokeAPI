# Package Installation

- Install Python requirements `pip install -r requirements.txt`

# API Usage

This is an API hosted on [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/) app that serves a JSON response according to the [randomly generated] joke.

Note that there are multiple use cases of programming languages that can be used here, and is up to you however PYTHON WILL BE THE MAIN, that is why there is a requirements.txt for python only.

To use this API, run the following example script using the requests libary and json libary:

```python
import requests, json

url = "https://hussbtwjokesapi.pythonanywhere.com/api/randomjoke"
params = "joke"

response = requests.get(url, params)

data = json.loads(response.text)

print(data["joke"])
```

The script above connects to the API via the 'requests' libary to connect to the API hosting server, take the argument joke as a paramater, and outputs a json response according to the [randomly generated (from a source)] joke
